- **Client Admin Dashboard**: Each client website includes a front-end interface for public users and an admin dashboard where clients can:
  - Log in and manage their employees.
  - Register new employees.
  - Monitor sales and progress through dashboards.
  - Manage social media campaigns (with relevant plugins).

## Analytica AI Admin Platform
We are developing an internal admin platform for **Analytic AI** to streamline client onboarding and website creation. Key features include:

- **Client Onboarding**: A registration system where clients can specify their website requirements (e.g., real estate web app, accountancy firm website, or e-commerce platform).
- **Automated Website Creation**: Using a dropdown menu or form, we can assign clients access to a pre-built template tailored to their industry (e.g., real estate, e-commerce). This template includes:
  ***- A front-end website.*** (I am not sure)
  - An admin dashboard for client-specific management.
  - API integration to dynamically generate content based on client inputs.
- **Efficiency**: Once a template is created, it can be reused across similar clients, reducing repetitive development. Updates are only applied when necessary.
- **Social Media Integration**: Exploring options to allow clients to manage social media campaigns directly from their admin dashboard.
